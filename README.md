## Architecture

- `RecordCubit`: Manages microphone permissions, recording states, and audio input.
- `FilesCubit`: Manages file storage, listing, and deletion.
- UI dynamically responds to state changes for seamless user experience.

The file format `.rn` is used for branding, while recordings are actually saved in standard formats (e.g., `.m4a`) internally.
